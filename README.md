# Halo Cursors

Cursor Files for my local machine were downloaded from this [link](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/standard)

Script was generated from message board [link](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=62799).  Specifically, reference wolf_II post from "18 Mar 2019, 00:09".  That is the code I copied, pasted, and modified.

Press the escape key to return cursor to default type (remove halo).
